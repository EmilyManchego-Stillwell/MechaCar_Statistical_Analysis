## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Output of Linear Regression Model](/Images/LinearRegressionOutput.png)
**Screenshot showing the output from the Linear Regression Model**
1. The variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set, because the are smaller than the significance level of 0.05%, are:
    - Intercept
    - Vehicle Length
    - Ground Clearance
2. The slope of the linear regression model is not considered to be zero because the p-value of the linear regression model is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05, resulting in a rejection of the null hypothesis. Rejection of a null hypothesis means the slope of a linear mode is not zero.
3. This linear model does not effectively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively due to the lack of significant variables. This linear model shows evidence of overfitting.
